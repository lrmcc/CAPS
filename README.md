# CAPS
Configurable Algorithmic Personal Schedule

This schedule application adjusts around life. 

It takes weather and daily occurences into account to form the best use of your time based on commitments, priorities, and to-do lists.

For example taking a walk daily might not be possible, so the schedule will reorganize based on your preferences. 
It will access weather APIs to determine if a walk is possible and prompt the user on what to do. 

It can interact with core devices to limit distractions by tabulating minutes spent on things like news sites, youtube, and social media to give a reflection to users on how "on-task" they are.
